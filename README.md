# ECG-EMBEDDED-SYSTEM
This project involved designing an embedded system which takes real time signals from the heart. It then converts these signals into waveforms and uses advanced algorithms to correct the waves in case the nurses had misplaced the probes. This is aimed at minimizing the error during diagnosis of heart diseases.
